<p>I was deployed in the Azure Cloud Platform Team to assist the transition from ticket-driven operations to modern DevOps including redesign, refactoring, and implementation towards automated and modular approaches. This also included onboarding new Azure Cloud Platform team members and upschooling & cultural transformation company wide.

My main focus was to build automated processes around Cloud Platform products involving development, support, and governance of the delivered platform, which consisted of pipelines, tooling, and infrastructure modules. Governance was planned and implemented in close collaboration with IT Security and management, communicated to development teams, and iterated on based-on feedback from relevant stakeholders.</p>

<p>I was deployed to design and develop a cloud- and data integration-platform to serve as a layer between their legacy systems and their concurrently developed webshop. In addition, FTZ needed a structured and transparent way to manage, modify, and extend business critical third party data. Because the project was the customer&rsquo;s entry into cloud based solutions, it included setting up all initial infrastructure and pipelines, effectively preparing it for future projects.</p>
<p>The delivered system transformed, warehoused, and served core business data from third-parties on all european car models, auto parts, and their respective relationships whilst also allowing FTZ to inspect and maintain the data. Furthermore, the system exposed e-commerce functionality and data from legacy systems.</p>
<p>Additionally I took on Lead role for the final six months, facilitating SCRUM as well as onboarding of new team members, reporting to management, and serving as the customer&rsquo;s primary contact.</p>

<p>I joined the team as a software engineer while the platform was being refined for several large customers. Here I contributed with development on three initiatives, effectively preparing the platform for market growth: improvements to the IMTC web application, a new marketing website and a data engineering platform. The data platform provided IMTC with a uniform approach to ingest, transform, and expose third party market data, not only to prepare it for consumption by the IMTC web application, but also to facilitate data scientists in building advanced analytics and market predictions.</p>

<p><p>Danske Bank&rsquo;s legacy foreign exchange post-trade system was to be re-implemented as microservices in an effort to increase scalability and maintainability. I initially joined the project as an IT Student as I applied this technological transition as a case study for my M.Sc. thesis. Once I graduated and got promoted, my responsibilities shifted: main responsibilities became development of microservices, infrastructure, and DevOps; additionally I took on responsibility for architecture the final year, focusing on robustness, uniformity, and performance.</p>
<p>The system handled all FX trades from market-facing systems and allowed traders to e.g. manage trades & positions, book new trades, and get price quotes all via a desktop UI. Mainly residing in the mainframe and a single monolithic service, the legacy system was to be split into several message-oriented and containerized microservices. I was a key individual in this transition and besides developing business functionality, I also ensured effectiveness of the system as well as the team through development of CI/CD, monitoring, libraries, and tools. Furthermore I led the effort of stabilizing the system for production and simplifying its operation by utilising Danske Banks internal cloud services, swapping out developed utility-services with standard solutions, and aligning technologies across services.</p>
